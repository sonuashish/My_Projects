      <h3>Here is a Time Line of Bhagwan Birsa Munda</h3>
      <ul id="li">
        <li><B>1875</B>- Born in Khunti Jharkhand</li>
        <li>Birsa's early years were spent with his parents at Chalkad.</li>
        <li>When he grew up, he shared an interest in playing the flute, in which he became an expert. He went around with the tuila, the one-stringed instrument made from the pumpkin, in his hand and the flute strung to his waist. Exciting moments of his childhood were spent on the akhara (the village wrestling ground).</li>
        <li>Driven by poverty Birsa was taken to Ayubhatu, his maternal uncle's village.  At Ayubhatu Birsa lived for two years. He went to school at Salga, run by one Jaipal Nag.</li>
        <li>He came in contact with a Christian missionary who visited a few families in the village which had been converted to Christianity. Birsa Munda understood very soon that Christian missionaries were converting tribals to Christianity. Birsa soon started to challenge the Christian missionaries and revolted against the conversion activities along with the Munda and Oraon communities.</li>
        <li>As Birsa was sharp in his studies, Jaipal Nag recommended him to join the German Mission School and Birsa converted to Christianity and was renamed as Birsa David, which later became Birsa Daud. After studying for a few years, he left the German Mission School.</li>
        <li>Birsa's long stay at Chaibasa from 1886 to 1890 constituted a formative period of his life. This period was marked by the German and Roman Catholic Christian agitation. In light of the freedom struggle, Sugana Munda withdrew his son from the school. Soon after leaving Chaibasa in 1890 Birsa and his family gave up their membership of the German mission and ceased to be Christian and reverted to his original traditional tribal religious system.</li>
        <li>In 1894, Birsa had grown up into a strong young man, shrewd and intelligent, and undertook the work of repairing the Dombari tank at Gerbera damaged by rains.</li>
        <li>While on a sojourn in the neighborhood of village Sankara in West Singhbhum district, he found a suitable companion, presented her parents with jewels, and explained his idea of marriage. Later, on his return from jail, he did not find her faithful to him and left her. Another woman who served him at Chalkad was the sister of Mathias Munda. On his release from prison, the daughter of Mathura Munda of Koensar who was kept by Kali Munda, and the wife of Jaga Munda of Jiuri insisted on becoming wives of Birsa. He rebuked them and referred the wife of Jaga Munda to her husband. Another rather well-known woman who stayed with Birsa was Sali of Burudih.</li>
        <li>He was arrested at Jamkopai forest in Chakradharpur on 3 February 1900. According to Deputy commissioner Ranchi, vide letter, 460 tribals were made accused in 15 different criminal cases, out of which 63 were convicted. One was sentenced to death, 39 to transportation for life and 23 to imprisoned for terms up to fourteen years. There were six deaths, including that of Birsa Munda in the prison during trials. Birsa Munda died in jail on 9 June 1900.</li>

                  यह धरती हमारी है, हम इसके रक्षक हैं। हर अन्याय के खिलाफ उलगुलान। यही पुरखों का रास्ता है। अप्राकृतिक ताकतों के खिलाफ एकजुट हो जाओ। उठो प्रकृति ने तुम्हे जीने के लिए सभी हथियार दिये हैं। मैं सभी दिशाओ से पुकार रहा हूँ।
